#Building a Data Model

"""
Drawing a picture of the data objects for our application and then
figuring out how to represent the object and their relationships

Basic Rule: Dont't put the same string data in twice - use a relationship instead

When there is one thing in the " real world" there should be one copy of 
that thing in the database
