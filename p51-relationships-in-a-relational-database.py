#Key Rules

"""
Never use your logical key as the primary key

Logical Keys can and do change, albeit slowly

Relationships thath are based on matching string fields are less efficient that 
integers

#Foreign Keys 

A foreing key is when a table has a column thath contains a key which 
poibt to the primary key of another tables

Whenn all primary keys are inteers , then all foreing keys are integers - this is good - very goog
